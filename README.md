# Liquid Glass Theme for Obsidian

This theme is a custom modification of the "Things" theme, designed to bring a modern, "liquid glass" aesthetic to your Obsidian workspace.

## Features

- **Liquid Glass UI:** A blurred, semi-transparent background is applied to major UI components like side panels, modals, and menus, creating a sense of depth and focus.

- **Modern Aesthetics:** Inspired by futuristic UI concepts, this theme provides a clean and visually appealing interface.
